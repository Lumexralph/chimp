# Chimp

Chimp is a programming language created solely for the main reason of learning how to build an interpreter using Go.

I love the web and also love low-level stuff too, I want to know what's happening under the hood.

I owe so much of this inspiration to [Thorsten Ball](https://twitter.com/thorstenball). He gave me his book at almost give away and I went straight to learning.

Features will get added to chimp with time.
